# Firebase Error Handling Guide

## PigeonUserDetail Type Casting Error

### Error Description
```
list<object> is not a subtype of type PigeonUserDetail in type cast
```

This error typically occurs during Firebase authentication operations, particularly after user registration or login. It's related to how Firebase's platform-specific code (which uses Pigeon for type-safe communication) handles user data.

### Root Causes
1. Type mismatch between what Firebase Auth returns and what the app expects
2. Version mismatch between Firebase Auth and Firebase Core packages
3. Inconsistent type handling in platform-specific code

### Solutions

#### 1. Use our custom Firebase handlers
We've implemented several handlers that wrap Firebase operations with proper error handling:
- `FirebaseUserHandler` - For safe Firebase Auth operations
- `FirebaseInitializer` - For proper Firebase initialization
- Custom error handling in main.dart

#### 2. Update Firebase dependencies
Make sure all Firebase dependencies are compatible with each other:
```yaml
firebase_core: ^2.24.2
firebase_auth: ^4.15.3
cloud_firestore: ^4.13.6
firebase_storage: ^11.5.6
cloud_functions: ^4.5.8
firebase_crashlytics: ^3.4.8
firebase_analytics: ^10.7.4
```

#### 3. Clear cache (if error persists)
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

#### 4. Rebuild iOS pods (for iOS issues)
```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod install
cd ..
```

## Other Common Firebase Errors

### "No implementation found for method X on channel Y"
This usually means the Firebase plugin wasn't properly initialized or there's a version mismatch.

**Solution:**
- Make sure to call `Firebase.initializeApp()` before using any Firebase services
- Check that all plugins are compatible versions

### "FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions"
This indicates security rules in Firestore or Storage are preventing your operation.

**Solution:**
- Check your security rules in the Firebase console
- Make sure the user is authenticated if your rules require it
- Temporarily relax rules during development (NOT for production)

### "The getter 'currentUser' was called on null"
This happens when trying to access Firebase Auth before it's initialized.

**Solution:**
- Ensure Firebase is initialized before using Auth services
- Use null checks when accessing Firebase Auth properties

## Best Practices

1. **Always handle errors**: Wrap Firebase operations in try-catch blocks
2. **Use null safety**: Use conditional access operators (`?.`) and null checks
3. **Implement proper initialization**: Follow our initialization sequence in `main.dart`
4. **Log errors properly**: Use Firebase Crashlytics in production
